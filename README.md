# DE-GUI
This will track the progress as the GUI for the Drane Engineering assistive arm is devloped

Image of current GUI with some labels:

The goal for this is to leverage OpenCV and a RealSense camera to allow the user to pick out items in an image (on the GUI) and for the robot to be able to differentiate and pick up those items. Additionally, there will be basic controls (think up, down, left, right) on the GUI to allow the user to control the robot manually.
